# PISA 2012 TEST : DATA EXPLORATION AND  FINDINGS COMMUNICATION

## by Mehdi Iddar


## Dataset

For this project, I chose PISA 2012 Dataset provided by Udacity. The original PISA 2012 dataset contained information from 485490 observations and 636 variables. After our data cleaning process, we condensed the number of variables to 9 : student id, country, gender, age, discipline, discipline level, math score, reading score, science score .All metrics under discipline have a scale of 4 levels : Never or hardly ever, Some lessons, Most lesons, Every lesson

The dataset can be downloaded at this link :

## Summary of Findings

- Math scores, reading scores and reading scores are normally distributed. And as it could be expected, there is a very strong and positive correlation between any pair of the three variables representing the scores of the three subjects.

- The pie chart show the gender is almost evenly split. However, there are differences in achievement based on gender:  Males students consistently score better than the Female students in Math. HoweverThe Female students consistently score better than the Male students in Reading.

- China_Shanghai has the highest math, science, and reading average scorse (above 600).And the three pole positions are occupied by : China_Shanghai, Singapore, Honk_Kong for the three subjects.

- For all discipline metrics, when discipline level is high 'never or hardly ever' math scores are high. the less the level of discipline is the less is the score of math.




## Key Insights for Presentation

FOt this part I focused of math score, and I tried to figure out summarise findings related to math score distribution in relation with gender, top countries ranking, and discipline metrics. Here are thekey insights :

- both Male score and Female score histograms are normally distributed. Although, The Males students consistently score better than the Female students in Math.

- China_Shanghai has the highest math average score (above 600).folowwed by Singapore and Honk_Kong

- Discipline conditions in a classroom have an effect on the score. For all discipline metrics, when discipline level is high 'never or hardly ever' math scores are high. the less the level of discipline is the less is the math score.
